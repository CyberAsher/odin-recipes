    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger;
             cook and stir until onion is soft and golden.
              Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; 
              cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
        <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
